## 💡 What Is the Terraria Item Spawner?

The **Item Spawner** is a cheat feature (often inside a trainer or mod menu) that allows players to add **any in-game item** to their inventory with just a click or hotkey. It works for **weapons, armor, tools, potions, building blocks, mounts, accessories, and even modded items** if you're using **TModLoader**.

Great for speedruns, building megabases, or just giving yourself everything instantly.
